# Decentralized Society Management System (DSMS)

## 📄 Project Description

A decentralized smart contract-based platform to manage all key aspects of residential societies — including society maintenance billing, milk delivery tracking, and daily water jar supply for individuals — using the Ethereum blockchain. This system aims to bring full transparency, automation, and digital control to society residents and administrators.

## 👁️ Project Vision

To create a transparent and self-managed ecosystem for residential societies by decentralizing utility tracking and payment systems. This includes:

* Enabling members to track and pay monthly maintenance
* Automating milk delivery records and billing
* Managing water jar requests and generating monthly bills
  All records are immutable, tamper-proof, and accessible to relevant stakeholders.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🧾 **Maintenance Management**: Residents can pay their maintenance bills directly through the contract. Records are public and secure.
* 🥛 **Milk Supply Tracking**: Admin updates daily milk quantity and billing for each resident. Users can view how many days they received milk and the total bill.
* 💧 **Water Jar Supply**: Users can request water jars, and admin tracks delivery with quantity and billing. Ideal for bachelors or people without water setups.
* 🔐 **Admin Controls**: Only the admin can update milk and water deliveries, preventing tampering.
* 📊 **Monthly Summary**: Residents can track usage and dues clearly on-chain.

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Integration with frontend DApp (React + Ethers.js) for easy UI
* Add tokenized payment system for milk/water using ERC-20 tokens
* DAO governance features for society voting and budgeting
* IPFS-based complaint management system with attachments
* Auto reminders and monthly PDF generation of bills
